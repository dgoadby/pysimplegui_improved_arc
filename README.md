# pysimplegui_improved_arc
Draw_arc in PySimpleGUI has a problem with certain start and end angles. This is an improved draw_arc.

The PySimpleGUI call do drawe arcs is: 
draw_arc(top_left,
    bottom_right,
    extent,
    start_angle,
    style = None,
    arc_color = "black",
    line_width = 1,
    fill_color = None)
